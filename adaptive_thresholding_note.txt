The general assumption that underlies all adaptive and local thresholding methods is that smaller regions of an image are more likely to have approximately uniform illumination. This implies that local regions of an image will have similar lighting, as opposed to the image as a whole, which may have dramatically different lighting for each region.

However, choosing the size of the pixel neighborhood for local thresholding is absolutely crucial.

The neighborhood must be large enough to cover sufficient background and foreground pixels, otherwise the value of T will be more or less irrelevant.

But if we make our neighborhood value too large, then we completely violate the assumption that local regions of an image will have approximately uniform illumination. Again, if we supply a very large neighborhood, then our results will look very similar to global thresholding using the simple thresholding or Otsuâ€™s methods.
